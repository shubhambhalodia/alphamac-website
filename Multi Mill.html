<p class="para">The AlphaMac Laboratory Scale table top Multi Mill is used for wet and dry granulation in pharmacy colleges, R&D institutions and pharmaceutical industry for research and development of pharmaceutical products. 
It is a self contained portable unit useful for granulating, pulverizing, mixing and size reduction. The Multi mill operates on the principle of variable force swing beaters having both knife and impact edges rotating within a selected screen to get the required size reduction.
The material is fed in the hopper, shredded and milled through beaters consisting of knife and impact edges. The rotation speed and direction of beaters could be adjusted through control panel. The material then passes through the cylindrical screen in spiral motion which helps keeping the temperature low and avoids chocking of material during the process. The material is collected in the container placed under the hopper.
In multi mill particle size reduction is done through impact in air, on material by blades moving at high speeds, inside a cylindrical hopper.
