<h3 style="margin-left:50px;">Application & Process:</h3>
<p class="para">The AlphaMac Laboratory Scale High Shear Mixer Granulator is a multi purpose processor equally suitable for high speed dispersion of dry powder, aqueous or solvent granulations and effervescent products and melts pelletization.
The High Shear Mixer Granulator performs dry mixing & wet granulating by basic design of the special four arm of the mixing impeller and sequences of the mixing process in the cylindrical mixing drum with rounded connection to the base plate, achieve another special effect.
The mixing process runs without varying pressure zone in the volume of mixing product. Separately driven multiple choppers can effectively intensify the mixing result in particular when liquid or paste components are added. During humidifying and granulating process of the products the chopper controls and regulates the granular spectrum and structure of the granules according to the product, chopper shape and time. A typical 3 minute dry mix operation than granulation by adding binder manually or spraying unit with pressurized. A free flowing granulate is produced after 3-5 minute and the granules are than rapidly discharge. The HSMG system requires only small quantities of granulating liquid or pastes to obtain the required granulate structure. This reduces the amount of drying energy required.
