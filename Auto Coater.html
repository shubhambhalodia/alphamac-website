<h3 style="margin-left:50px;">Application & Process:</h3>
<p class="para">The AlphaMac Laboratory Scale Lab Automatic Tablet  Coater for small batch size production or R&D purpose. It is high efficiency and intelligent automated film & sugar coating advance technology is mainly used in pharmaceutical and food industries. Featuring mechatronis and confirming to the requirement of cGMP. It is a high efficiency, energy saving, safe and clean equipment for film & sugar coating of tablets, Pills and candies with film - organic solvent and aqueous coating.
The tablet to be coated make continuous complicated orbital motion the closed rotating drum under the action of a streamline of Baffles. During the motion coating medium automatically sprays according to the technological process and rational technological parameters, at the same time hot filtered air supplied under a negative pressure. The hot air penetrates through the tablets core layers and is discharged from the bottom of the layers, so that the coating medium sprayed on the surface of the tablet cores will dry rapidly and evenly, thus forming a solid and smooth surface film on tablet.
